# Docker compose and networking (Part three)

- Refactoring of the imperative docker pipeline using a declarative file (yaml of course) and `docker-compose`
- Add an ingress reverse proxy to the votingapp solution.
- Use a docker volume to configure nginx.

There are 3 files with samples for that session:
- `pipelines-compose.sh`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `session3.sh`
